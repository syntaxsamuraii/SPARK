# SPARK
A simple programming language hoping to be used for Game dev

Printing a text to console
```WRITE("Hello World!");```

Creating a variable
```VAR myvariable = 025;``` int
```VAR myvariable = helloguys;``` string

Arithemetic calculations
```WRITE(1+1);```

Creating a function
```FN CoolFunction();```

Changing value of a variable
```SET VAR myvariable = 555;```

Adding actions to functions
```SET FN CoolFunction = WRITE("Hello");```

Call a function
```CALL CoolFunction();```

Adding forever loop
```FOREVER():WRITE(myvariable);```

Random example of all features shown

1 - ```FN SayHi();```

2 -```FN RunFunctions();```
3 -```VAR hiText = Hi from Spark;```
4 -```VAR anotherText = Spark is very cool! lol just kidding;```
5 -```VAR memeboy = Spark users mew in skibidi!;```
6 -```VAR laugh = hehe;```
7 -```SET FN SayHi = WRITE(hiText);```
8 -```SET FN SayHi = WRITE(anotherText);```
9 -```SET FN RunFunctions = WRITE(memeboy);```
10 -```SET FN RunFunctions = CALL SayHi();```
11 -```SET VAR laugh = haha;```
12 -```CALL RunFunctions();```
13 -```FOREVER():WRITE(laugh);```

has been under dev of 1 and (1/2) days
